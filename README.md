## Description:

Project Description: Our project is about an alien named Bow, who is on a mission to destroy earth with his powerful fart. The concept and theme of our project is futuritsic and humorous, it links the gap between comedy and sci-fi. We strived to create a futuristic and sci-fi experience for the users, but to also surprise them with the video's ending.

## Process:

We first started brainstorming ideas for the video, and we decided to create a fake documentary that had comedic elements (option 2). 
We then decided on a wireframe for the website, and how to include user interactivity. We wanted to have the users to first be introduced to the character Bow, and then move to the video.

## Reflection:

We believe that we have created a website that bookends our initial concept.
