# U-Lens Mission Briefing
 
## Description:

Project Description: Our project is about an ET (Extraterrestrial) agent named Bow, who is impersonating as the current president of the United States, on a mission to destroy earth with his powerful fart. The concept and theme of our project is futuritsic and humorous, it links the gap between comedy and sci-fi. We strived not only to create a futuristic and sci-fi experience for the users, but to also surprise them with the video ending.

## Process:

We first started brainstorming ideas for the video, and we decided to create a fake documentary that had comedic elements (option 2). 
We then decided on a wireframe for the website, and how to include user interactivity. We wanted to have the users to first be introduced to the character Bow, and then move on to the video. We divided our tasks equally, where each one had separate responsibilities i.e. creating video, editing video, making the website, and writing the documentation.

## Reflection:

We believe that we have created a website that bookends our initial concept. We are satisfied with the final look and feel of our website, in the sense that it completely captures the futuristic feel and an outer-worldly theme.
